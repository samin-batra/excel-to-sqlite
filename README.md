# excel-to-sqlite

This repo contains a small script to scrape files from the ergast F1 api website, extract them and then create a SQLite database from that data.


Link to ergast F1 Api Page: http://ergast.com/mrd/
Link to SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/index.html

In order to run the script, clone the code base onto your local machine. Install the requirements from the requirements.txt file.
Next, run the main file.
